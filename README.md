## # Ch 5 Designing business logic in a microservice architecture

## Discussion Questions & Prompts

*   DDD & Aggregate Root implementation in Ironboard. What would we do differently?
    *   Assignments seems like it was a good implementation
    *   Compliance, maybe not so much.
*   Going hexagonal in rails seems like a big lift. No built in way to have aggregates play nice with Active Record. Also, no nice way to interact with objects that aren't active record objects. No question, just ranting.
    *   Agreed. Rails framework is good for getting an app started, but seems to be bad for long-lived, well-designed code. What do we think? Drop Rails? ðŸ‘¹
    *   +1. Rails definitely encourages designing your application in a way that does not strongly correlate with DDD and event sourcing, would be nice to use frameworks that are less opinionated so that we could structure our code (into Aggregates, Services, Events, etc) as we wish
*   How are we thinking about event sourcing and audit logs? (Seems like it would be pretty useful, wonder if we should put this on our engineering roadmap)
*   How does Segment play into event sourcing and the future of our codebase? We're sending a lot of events. Is there a unified schema for the data we're sending up?
*   Event sourcing sounds a lot like Redux. Discuss.
*   How often should snapshots be created? Would there be any benefit to always creating a current snapshot after every event creation? 
    *   It seems like the more you keep your snapshots up to date (closer to the most recent event), the less issues you will have with event versioning and the necessity of upcasting 
*   What's the main difference between publishing domain events and event sourcing?
*   The lack of historical data in Learn has been a point of contention in the past. Why don't all apps use an event-first approach?
*   How do you query an event based application?
*   What are our Domains/Aggregates?
*   Are we using Services "Correctly"?
*   Is Event Sourcing all or nothing? Do you get any benefit doing this in part of a monolith?
    *   Does incremental Event Sourcing help with slicing up a monolith into microservices?
*   ReflectiveMutableCommandProcessingAggregate

### Intro

- The Aggregate pattern structures a service's business logic as a collection of aggregates.

- An aggregate is a cluster of objects that can be treated as a unit

  - avoid possibility of object references spanning service boundaries (pass primary key values rather than object references)

  - Transaction can only create or update a single aggregate

### 5.1 Business logic organization patterns

  - An inbound adapter handles requests from clients and invokes the business logic

  - An outbound adapter (invoked by business logic) invokes other services & apps

  - **Transaction script pattern**

    - write a method called a transaction script to handle request from presentation tier (procedural code, when OO is OVERkill)

    - one set of classes implements behavior and another stores state

    - scripts usually located in service classes, has one method for each request

    - script accesses the db using data access objects (DAOs)

    - good for simple business logic, not good for complex

  -** Domain model pattern**

    - object model, network of relatively small classes

    - closely mirror the real world

    - easier to test and extend

    - some classes have only state state or behavior, many contain both

  - **Domain-driven design**

    - *Entity* -- object that has a persistent identity

    - *Value object* -- object that is a collection of values

    - *Factory* -- object or method that implements object creation logic that's too complex to be done directly by a constructor. can hide concrete classes that are instantiated

    - *Repository* -- object that provides access to persistent entities

    - *Service* -- object that implements business logic that doesn't belong in an entity or value object

    - *Aggregate* -- a cluster of domain objects within a boundary that can be treated as a unit

### 5.2 Designing a domain model using the DDD aggregate pattern



*   Lack of explicit boundaries causes problems when updating business objects
    *   Business objects have invariants (rules that must be enforced) 
*   optimistic vs pessimistic locking
*   pessimistic: locked at moment of access, nothing else can access
*   optimistic: state saved at moment of access, record re-read before commit, state compared, if changed, rollback

  **- An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects within a boundary that can be treated as a unit**

**    - consists of a root entity and one or more entities and value objects e.g. Order, Consumer, Restaurant**

    - decompose domain model into chunks, clarify scope of operations

    - often loaded in its entirety from db

  - Aggregate rules

    - #1) reference only the aggregate root

    - #2) aggregates reference each other by identity instead of object references

    - #3) one transaction creates or updates the aggregate

### 5.3 Publishing domain events

  - something that has happened to an aggregate, represented by class in the domain model

  - property has primitive value or a value object, metadata, event ID and a timestamp

  - event enrichment: events contain information that consumers need

  - split responsibility of publishing events between aggregate and the service that invokes it

  - aggregate generates the events when it changes state and returns them to the service

  - could also have aggregate root accumulate events in a field and have service retrieve and publish them

  - consuming domain events

    - domain events are published as messages to message broker (eg. Kafka)
